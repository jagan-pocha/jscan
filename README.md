# 🧩 JSCAN - JSON Validator App

A powerful React application that provides a side-by-side interface for defining JSON templates and validating JSON data against them.

## ✨ Features

### 📝 Template Builder (Left Panel)
- **Interactive Field Creation**: Add fields with names and data types (string, number, boolean, object, array)
- **Nested Objects**: Create complex nested object structures
- **Array Support**: Define arrays of primitives or objects  
- **Visual Template Display**: Real-time formatted JSON preview of your template
- **Sample Templates**: Load pre-built templates to get started quickly

### 📄 JSON Data Input (Right Panel)
- **Smart Text Area**: Paste and edit JSON data with syntax highlighting
- **Real-time Validation**: Immediate feedback on JSON formatting errors
- **Auto-formatting**: Format your JSON with proper indentation
- **Sample Data**: Load sample JSON data that matches the template structure

### 🔍 Validation Features
Three powerful validation modes:

1. **✅ Find Missing Fields**: Identifies fields present in template but missing from JSON data
2. **🚫 Find Additional Fields**: Shows fields in JSON data not defined in the template  
3. **🔎 Check Data Types**: Compares actual data types against template specifications

### 📊 Results Display
- **Interactive Data Grid**: Powered by AG Grid with sorting, filtering, and resizing
- **Color-coded Issues**: Visual indicators for different types of validation issues
- **Detailed Information**: Shows field names, expected vs actual types, and issue categories
- **Results Summary**: Quick overview of total issues found by category
